# React-Cshrp-SqlSrvr
React Website Project

This a project done using React Library, with C# (.Net Core), MSFT SQL Server. I have provided here some of the code that I have written recently.

If you are trying to get an idea of my code: my recommendation would be to see the Contact Us folder and to see the code running live, go to http://sellers.azurewebsites.net/contactus .

Thanks,

Asim
